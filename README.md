# Assembly-Project--Sum-of-Squares-at-Odd-Positions
This project is written in x86 Assembly language (MASM/TASM style, `.model small`) and is intended for DOS environments or emulators like DOSBox.

A vector with a maximum of 10 elements (digits only) is read from the keyboard, and the sum of the squares of the elements located at odd positions is displayed.
